## Dataset

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.


## Summary of Findings

Average age of people that didn't attend the appointment 34.2
Average age of people that attend the appointment 37.7
The result clearly shows 23% no_show rate compared to 19% show rate for patient with scholarship
The result clearly shows 27% no_show rate compared to 16% show rate for patient that recieved sms

## Key Insights for Presentation
I introduce each of the variables one by one. The gender bar chart shows more female patient showing up for scheduled appointment compared to male patient.
Patients that get sms tends to miss showing up for scheduled appointment compared to those that didn't recieve any message.
